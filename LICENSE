1. No Warranties (None. Zero. Zip.)
This software is provided "as-is," much like a toddler's promise to behave: no guarantees. If it works, cool! If it doesn't, well...good luck with that shit. If this code messes with your system you may not sue me, my cattle, or any of my assets for that matter. They're protected with an LLC, and LLCs protect your from EVERYTHING. 

2. Liability (On You, Not Me)
By downloading this code, you acknowledge that you alone are responsible for any explosions, fires, or unauthorized connections to Russian databases resulting from its use. If something goes wrong, just remember: that’s on you, buddy.

3. Free Use and Abuse
You can copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, sell, and pretty much do anything you want with this software, short of blaming me for it. If you somehow make a billion dollars off this, feel free to send a thank-you email. Or don’t. Your choice.

4. No Support (Ever)
I’m probably off doing something else, so don’t expect tech support, bug fixes, or hand-holding. If you have a question, refer to the official documentation, which doesn’t exist, or consult the void.

5. Disclaimer (In All Caps)
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USER ASSUMES ALL RISKS. MAY CAUSE THE STRANGE DESIRE TO REWRITE IT IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE.
